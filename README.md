# 3DIM-Tic-Tac-Toe
This repository contains my first game. Fundamental principle of the game is based on traditional Tic-Tac-Toe. However, to increase compexity, 4th field and 3rd dimension are added. To win, player must place 4 cubes in straight line - regardless whether it is horizontal, vertical or diagonal.

TO DO:
-Add multiplayer feature
-Add winning animation where all cubes (except 4 that make a winner) explode or fly away.
